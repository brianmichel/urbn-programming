URBN Programming Group README

Goals
-----

We're all programmers, or at least interested in programming. However, on a normal day we are siloed to one or two languages. The point of this group is to play with a language for a couple of weeks, and learn something new, or interesting about the world of programming. 

Who knows, you might also learn something about someone else, or perhaps, even yourself.

Structure
-----

Here's what I'm thinking (which is subject to change) in regards to the structure of this group. Learning a new syntax is great, but without applying that new knowledge of syntax, it's pretty useless. I'm proposing we evaluate two languages (which may take a few weeks), but we then pick a language and build a fully functioning web app, api, client, whatever in it. 

This will allow us to exercise the language as well as encounter problems we may have never seen with the koans, or other source material.

I'd like to have weekly meetings on Thursdays after work to discuss any questions, open up a working session, etc for everyone. This (like everything else) is subject to change to meet the needs of the group
